# Advent of Code 2021

I just started learning Ruby, figured I'd try with this language to practice. 

I apologize in advance to all Rubyists for the quality of my solutions. If you have tips / feedback, I'm all ears!  

## Start a new day

To start new day, run the following command:

```
$ ./generate_day [day_number]
```

By default, the generated folder will be the current day. e.g. if you run this command on Dec 4th, the folder generated will be `04`
If you want to generate a day other than the current date, just provide the `day_number`. e.g. `./generate_day 04`.
